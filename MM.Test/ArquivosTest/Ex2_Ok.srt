00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,890
In our previous tutorials, we’ve discussed
the basics of semiconductors, band gap, current

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,289
carriers, and its classification.

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,239
We learned that in order for a semiconductor
material to be useful, it needs to be doped

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,750
with an impurity atom and it could be a pentavalent
atom to produce an n-type material or a trivalent

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,570
atom to come up with a p-type material.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,300
Now, if we take a small piece of semiconductor
material and dope half of it with a trivalent

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,730
atom and the other half with a pentavalent
atom, that would result in a semiconductor

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,140
device with p-type and n-type portions, with
a pn junction where they meet.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,579
In this video, we are going to talk about
this pn junction, as it is the basis for diodes.

10
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,439
After doping an intrinsic semiconductor material,
usually silicon, so that part of it is p-type

11
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,969
and the other part is n-type, a pn junction
is formed at the boundary between the p and

12
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,359
n regions.

13
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,250
In the p region, the majority carriers are
holes while in the n region, the majority

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,539
carriers are free electrons.

15
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,269
When the pn junction is formed, the free electrons
in the n region begin to diffuse across the

16
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,509
junction and combine with the holes in the
p region near the junction.

17
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:13,608
This makes the n region lose free electrons
and creates a layer of positive charges near

18
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:14,728
the junction.

19
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,019
As the free electrons combine with the holes
in the p region, the p region also loses holes

20
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,920
and creates a layer of negative charges near
the junction.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,810
These two layers of positive and negative
charges create a region where charge carriers

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,350
are depleted.

23
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:31,548
This region is called, fittingly, the depletion
region.

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,259
In reality, the depletion region is formed
in an incredibly short amount of time and

25
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,810
its width is very thin compared to the p and
n regions.

26
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,618
The depletion region will continue to expand
until the total negative charge in the depletion

27
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:46,728
region repels any further diffusion of electrons
into the p region.

28
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:50,418
This time, the depletion region acts as a
barrier to the movement of electrons across

29
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,828
the junction.

30
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:56,339
In the depletion region, there are many positive
and negative charges on opposite sides, and

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,340
as described by Coulomb’s law, if there’s
a positive charge and a negative charge near

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,539
each other, there is a force acting on these
charges.

33
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:07,149
The forces between the positive and negative
charges in the depletion region create an

34
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,469
electric field which blocks the free electrons
from the n region to flow across the junction.

35
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:16,789
In order for the electrons to move through
this electric field, a certain amount of voltage

36
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:22,349
equal to the barrier potential of the electric
field must be applied across the pn junction

37
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,769
with the proper polarity.

38
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,900
Now, let’s try to analyze the formation
of the pn junction and the depletion region

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,960
through an energy diagram.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,349
The energy levels of the valence and conduction
bands in an n-type material are lower than

41
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,979
the valence and conduction bands in a p-type
material.

42
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:43,869
This is because, trivalent impurities exert
lower forces on the outer-shell electrons

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,530
and lower forces mean that the electron orbits
are slightly larger and have greater energy.

44
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,439
If we try to examine the energy diagram for
a pn junction at the instant of formation,

45
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,719
we can see that the valence and conduction
bands in the n region are at a noticeably

46
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,859
lower energy level compared to the p region
valence and conduction bands.

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,360
But, we can also see that the upper part of
the conduction band in the n region and the

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,910
lower part of the conduction band in the p
region overlap.

49
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,829
In this case, the free electrons in the upper
part of the conduction in the region can easily

50
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,710
diffuse across the pn junction and temporarily
become free electrons in the lower part of

51
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,960
the p region conduction band.

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,629
Temporary because, after crossing the pn junction,
these free electrons rapidly lose energy and

53
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,620
fall into the holes in the valence band of
the p region.

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,960
As the free electrons from the upper part
of the n region conduction band cross the

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,650
junction, the depletion region starts to form
and expand.

56
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,030
But, the energy level of the n region conduction
band also starts to decrease.

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,710
This process will continue until there will
be no electrons left in the n region conduction

58
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,260
band with enough energy to cross the junction.

59
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:54,539
At that time, the junction is at equilibrium
and the depletion region is complete because

60
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,179
the diffusion is done.

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,099
As you can see in the energy diagram, the
top of the n region conduction band and the

62
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,329
bottom of the p region conduction band is
now aligned and this time, there’s now an

63
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,740
energy “hill” that the electron from the
n-region must climb in order to get to the

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,330
p region.

65
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,920
Another thing to observe here is that the
energy level of the valence band in the n

66
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,418
region also decreased.

67
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,649
So the energy gap between the valence band
and the conduction band in the n region remains

68
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,848
the same.

69
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:26,899
In this video, we discussed about the pn junction,
its formation and the formation of the depletion

70
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,209
region.

71
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:32,288
We also discussed the barrier potential and
the energy diagrams of the pn junction and

72
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:34,009
the depletion region.
